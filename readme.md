# File Wizard

File Wizard is a cross-platform tool, written in Java, that allows you to rename and move files freely. The software
is free under GPL3 license so feel free to share or modify to meet your need. 

Why use File Wizard? The inspiration behind the implementation of this app is to help organizing your files, 
specifically media files such images and videos. Imagine you have a folder containing all pictures from five years ago, 
you would like to tidy them up by having date/time prefix for each file name (2022-01-01-IMG_0001.JPG) then move them 
to sub-folders, let say by year-month (2022-11, 2022-12) when the photos were taken, this app will help you do 
that.
